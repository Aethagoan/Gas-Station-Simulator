# The Problem  
We are making a gas station simulation where cars arrive at a station, line up at a pump, pump gas and pay, and leave or/and buy things from the store.  
  
Our simulation will need to keep track of stockpiles for gasoline (tanks), amount of money paid, and sort of realistically simulate the time at the pump.
